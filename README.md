Student Marks Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning model that predicts student marks based on the number of hours studied using Linear Regression.

The dataset used here is "C:\Users\AJAY\Downloads\Student_Marks.csv"

 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

 Dataset

Student_Marks.csv

Columns used:

time_study → Hours studied

Marks → Student scores

 Workflow

Load and explore the dataset

Split data into training and testing sets

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate the model using MAE and R² score

Visualize the regression line

Predict marks for a given study time

 Output

Model performance metrics (MAE, R²)

Graph showing study hours vs marks

Prediction for a custom input (e.g., 9.25 hours)

 Use Case

Beginner-friendly ML project to understand regression, evaluation metrics, and data visualization.# Basicml.py
